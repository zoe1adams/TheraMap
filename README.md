# 🧠 TheraMap

TheraMap is a mental health resource finder designed to simplify the process of connecting users with licensed therapists that best meet their needs. Users can receive therapist recommendations by simply answering a few questions through an intuitive, chat-style intake system—no account or login required.

This project was created as part of a group collaboration for the FAMU + Eli Lilly Hackathon, focused on accessible mental health tech solutions.
